# random-commenter README

This extension adds random funny comments to your code at random intervals. It's a light-hearted tool to bring some humor into your coding routine. Keep in mind this is my first ever VS-CODE Extension so it is something simpel.

## Features

- Adds random comments to your code at random intervals.
- Detects the programming language of the file and uses the appropriate comment syntax.

Example:

\!\[Random Commenter in action\](images/random-commenter.gif)

> Tip: The comments are non-intrusive and are intended to add a bit of fun without disrupting your workflow.

## Requirements

This extension does not have any special requirements or dependencies.

## Extension Settings

This extension does not add any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point. It works out of the box without any configuration.

## Known Issues

There are no known issues at the moment. If you encounter any, please report them on the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/MitjaCH/random-commenter/issues).

## Release Notes

### 1.0.0

Initial release of Random Commenter.
